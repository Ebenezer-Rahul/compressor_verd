It was a used sedan, low miles, 2019. A new car wouldn’t have made sense for someone like him, a person who drove shitbox beaters for decades, ones bought with cash and coasting on old registration; a person who dodged W2-G’s like draft letters after collecting on countless machine hits, these tax forms sent to defunct addresses, sometimes signed by someone else for a piece of the hit if the casino staff was being difficult.
A new car would’ve felt alien, something he wouldn’t have maintained, wouldn’t have changed the oil or rotated the tires. I got him something he could drive for a while without feeling guilty about not taking care of it, something he desperately needed to drive to the bay, to see his other son and his grandchildren, to see me and the blonde guy from the video where we laugh at a monkey. The price wasn’t trivial, but it wasn’t out of line. Still, I didn’t tell him the full amount, and I said he owed me nothing, that it was for him, finally. He said he’d force compensation on me, sneak it into my pocket, and I said good luck trying. He never got to see the car.
